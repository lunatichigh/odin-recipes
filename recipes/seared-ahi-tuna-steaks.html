    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (5 ounce) ahi tuna steaks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice steak into 1/2-inch thick slices across the grain.</li>
        <li>Whisk together soy sauce, sugar, cornstarch, and ginger in a bowl until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is smooth. Place steak slices into the marinade, and stir until well-coated.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and cook steak strips in batches in hot oil so as not to crowd the pan. Cook and stir until well-browned, about 3 minutes, and remove steak from the wok to a bowl. Repeat with remaining steak, adding more oil as needed, and set the cooked meat aside.</li>
        <li>Return cooked steak strips to the hot wok, and stir in onion. Toss steak and onion together until onion begins to soften, about 2 minutes, then stir in green pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir the mixture until peppers have turned bright green and started to become tender, about 2 minutes more, then add tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Stir everything together to mix and blend flavors, and serve.</li>
    </ol>

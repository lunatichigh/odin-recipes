This is a The Odin Project lesson about creating a recipe website.

Once I am done with this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to...

1. Use the command line in Linux to create and navigate my website's file structure.
2. Create and clone a repository from Github to my local machine(via the CLI).
3. Create a multipage website utilizing relative links and images.
4. Create lists using ordered lists and unordered lists.
5. Commit often with meaningful commit messages.
6. Commit to Github using Git via the terminal.
